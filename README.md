## Info

App built from scratch (meaning without `create-react-app`). It's fairly minimul,
I haven't even included some babel stuff for modern class syntax.

If I where to have more time on the project I would allow the user to choose
new co-ordinates using the map drag. Also I'd like to have more styling (fonts etc)
and have the app better optimised for responsiveness, eg when a user changes the parameters
the view lags, it might be nice to have some loading icons etc.

Start the app with `npm start`.

When it loads you can change the Longitude and Latitude to update the map
and graph.
